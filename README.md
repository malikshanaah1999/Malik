- 👋 Hi, I’m Malik Shanaah.  It's a great pleasure to share and contribute your ideas and projects with me.

- 👀 Currently, I'm working on a fascinating project I'm doing for my GP in partial fulfillment of requirements for a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunication Engineering.
  + My insight is represented by constructing a traffic management system. In this system, if there is a crowded lane you are driving in, then automatically YOUR vehicle will 
  track you onto another route. This will get you to your destination in as little time as possible. These processes will be carried out 1000 kilometers away from the crowded 
  region!
  
- 🌱 My project used mainly Python, as well as many libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, etc, since there are thousands of messages and negotiations between your vehicle and others 
     to tell you that there is traffic in some lanes, as mentioned above!.
     
- 💞️ Actually, besides my field (Telecommunication engineering) which has a lot of tracks, you can dive into it! My passion for WEB development was my aim. After two months of HARD-WORK,
      I have finished my first website (Malik Overflow), which is built from scratch without using any framework.
      
- 📫 Nowadays, I'm diving into React.js which is my favorite framework in the FE suite. For BE, I am using JS, as well. So I am learning Node.js/Express!
Stay tuned for a variety of projects and ideas to share with each other.
